Money laundering is most commonly associated with tax avoidance. However, other individuals may attempt to launder money in order to conceal their identity or finance their operations. \u2018Suspicious activity\u2019 is a very difficult concept to define because it can vary from one transaction to another based upon all the circumstances surrounding the transaction or group of transactions. For example, transactions by one customer may be normal based on our knowledge of that customer and their pattern of activity, while similar transactions by another customer may be suspicious. Many factors are involved in determining whether transactions are suspicious including the amount, the nature of the transaction and frequency of deposits/withdrawals from the system.","Ridima is committed to fighting money laundering and complying fully with anti-money laundering laws in the Nigeria.
